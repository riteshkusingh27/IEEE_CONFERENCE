        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-4">ORIGINALITY OF SUBMITTED PAPERS</h3>
        <p>
          Papers submitted to SPACE 2025 shall contain original work by the author(s) that have not been published
          or submitted for publication elsewhere. The IEEE anti-plagiarism policy is applicable to all submissions.
          The author(s) are solely responsible for any plagiarized submission.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-4">PAPER SUBMISSION</h3>
        <p>
          All papers are required to be prepared and submitted in the IEEE Standard two-column conference format
          of A4 size in English. Papers must be three to six pages in length, including texts, figures, photographs,
          and references. Any submitted paper that exceeds six pages will be rejected. The first page must include
          the title of the paper, author(s), affiliations, address, and text. Do not include page numbers on submitted
          documents. Failing to conform to the standard format will result in rejection. Detailed format information
          is available on the IEEE Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authors are required to use the standard IEEE manuscript template for conferences. The Microsoft Word
          template can be downloaded from the IEEE conference template page:
